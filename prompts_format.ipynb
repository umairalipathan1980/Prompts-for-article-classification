    "    Let's start by considering each category in detail:\n",

These studies aim to understand disease factors or evaluate the safety and efficacy of investigational drugs, procedures, or devices. Does the title or abstract mention such a study?\n",
    "    2. **Medical Device**: Next, consider whether the article discusses any instrument, apparatus, machine, implant, software, or similar article used in the diagnosis, cure, treatment, or prevention of disease. Remember, this excludes products that work through chemical action, such as drugs. Does the article describe or evaluate such a device?\n",
    "    3. **Safety and Performance**: Then, evaluate whether the article involves assessing the safety, clinical efficacy, potential side effects, user experiences, regulatory compliance, or comparative effectiveness of a medical device. Does the article focus on how safe or effective a device or method is?\n",
    "    4. **{parameter_name}**: Reflect on whether the article addresses this specific parameter. Does the title or abstract mention anything about {parameter_name} which can be defined as {parameter_definition}?\n",
    "    5. **Vital Signs**: Consider if the article discusses vital signsâ€”key metrics such as blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, temperature, pulse oximetry, or end-tidal CO2. Does the article measure or analyze any of these vital signs?\n",
    "    6. **Stress**: Finally, think about whether the article involves stress, defined as a neurobiological response to stressors that disrupt homeostasis, causing physical, mental, or emotional tension. Does the article explore how stress affects individuals or groups?\n",
    "    As you evaluate the title and abstract of the article, work through each of these categories systematically. Carefully apply the definitions provided, and be sure not to make any assumptions or invent information that is not explicitly mentioned.\n",
